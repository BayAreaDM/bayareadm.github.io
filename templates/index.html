          <p class="text-justify">
            Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals began 22 years ago as a small television fundraiser in Provo, Utah, and has grown to become the world’s leading children’s charity,
            raising more than $2.2 billion for the 170 pediatric hospitals in its international alliance.
            Most of the funds have been donated $1 at a time through the sale of paper Miracle Balloons at corporate sponsors like Costco, Wal-Mart and Rite Aid, which have contributed more than
            $300 million to the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals’ national program.<br />
