                Reducing a child's anxiety around medical procedures and surgery lowers the need for anesthesia and increases success in recovery. Before a surgical procedure, our Child Life specialist provides preparation, familiarization, and support for children undergoing tests, surgeries, and/or other medical procedures.
                Child Life services include:

                Medical research is an important part of the work that goes on at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland. The research arm, known as Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, or CHORI, is one of the nation's top 10 pediatric research centers in terms of National Institutes of Health grant funding.
              </p>
              <p>
                Researchers are making significant progress in such areas as diagnosing and treating pediatric cancers, sickle cell disease, AIDS and HIV, hemophilia, cystic fibrosis, developing prenatal techniques for diagnosing mental retardation and birth defects, and improving infant nutrition. Research institute efforts have led to UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland operating the only nonprofit sibling donor umbilical cord blood bank in the United States.

              UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland will never turn a child away, regardless of the family’s ability to pay for medical care. Due to this commitment to serving the community, Children’s provides free or discounted care, also known as “charity care,” to families who don’t qualify for government-sponsored health insurance and who meet certain eligibility requirements. In 2013 we provided over $9,000,000 in Charity Care to families who needed healthcare for their children.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
              Approximately 73% of our patients at UCSF Benioff Children’s Hospital Oakland are enrolled in government-sponsored health insurance such as Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). Our hospital receives 20 cents back for every dollar spent on the crucial care these patients need, creating a huge shortfall in government funding. The unpaid costs incurred by Children’s to provide services to these patients in 2013 was over $141,000,000.

              UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital Oakland believes that good, quality health care is about so much more than the latest pediatric technology and medicine. It takes the combined efforts of doctors, family members and support services within the community to help children heal both physically and emotionally. When it comes time to leave the hospital and resume life at home, it's important for families to feel confident that they are ready and able to continue the healing process.

              Medical social workers are available to assist patients and families with a wide range of issues that may arise. The department offers counseling, advocacy, support, information and referrals. Social workers help avoid delays in inpatient discharges, as they work with families on practical issues to assist with the child getting ready to go home. Social workers are an integral member of the interdisciplinary team and work very closely with the medical staff. They also handle child abuse reporting obligations on behalf of the medical team.
